            <p>Thank you dad for all the fun I had throughout the years. I enjoyed the times when you cooked food, especially the seafood. I missed the times we had when we travelled to different countries. I enjoyed that time when we had stargazing during Earth Day. I hope we can travel more in the future. I love you dad.</p>
